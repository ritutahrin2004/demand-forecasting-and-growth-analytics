## Project Status Update (In Progress)

This project is being reframed from a broad demand forecasting and growth analytics framework into a **decision-focused analysis** aimed at identifying and prioritizing the largest sources of **preventable net revenue leakage** across inventory stockouts, delivery/fulfillment issues, and marketing inefficiency.

The underlying data model, forecasting logic, and analytical components remain valid. Upcoming updates will focus on quantifying trade-offs, risk, and executive decision scenarios.

End-to-end analytics project built on grocery demand forecasting and growth analytics, integrating transactional, inventory, marketing, and delivery data to support executive decision-making.
